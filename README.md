# Berkeley-Pacman-2020
This is my code for Berkeley's Pacman projects (projects 0, 1 and 2) written in Python3.6

Python 3.6 is the recommended version. Python3.8 will not work, and I'm not sure about any other versions.

The link for the original starter code for the Pacman projects is this: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/projects/
