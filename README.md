# Berkeley-Pacman-2020
This is my code for Berkeley's Pacman projects (projects 0, 1 and 2) written in Python3.6

Python 3.6 is the recommended version. Python 3.8 will not work, and I'm not sure about any other versions.

**This only contains the files that need to be edited for the project.**
The link for the original starter code for the Pacman projects is this: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp20/projects/
